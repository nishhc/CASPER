[GENERAL]
# The name for this primer design run. Used for naming output files.
run_name = Default_RPA_Design

[PRIMER_PARAMETERS]
# Desired length for forward and reverse primers in nucleotides.
# RPA primers are typically longer than PCR primers to facilitate recombinase binding.
primer_length = 30-38

# The maximum allowed length for a mononucleotide run (e.g., AAAAA).
# A value of 4 is a standard practice to prevent polymerase slippage.
max_homopolymer_run = 4

# The allowed percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases.
# 40-60% provides a good balance of stability and specificity.
gc_content_range_percent = 30-70

[AMPLICON_PARAMETERS]
# The desired size of the amplified product (the amplicon) in base pairs.
# RPA is most efficient with smaller amplicons.
amplicon_length_range_bp = 120-180

[OUTPUT_SETTINGS]
# The maximum number of top-scoring primer pairs to output in the final report.
# Reviewing around 20 pairs is usually sufficient to find a few excellent candidates.
max_output_sets = 20
