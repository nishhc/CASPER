[GENERAL]
# The name for this primer design run. Used for naming output files.
run_name = Default_RPA_Design

[PRIMER_PARAMETERS]
# Desired length for forward and reverse primers in nucleotides.
# RPA primers are typically longer than PCR primers to facilitate recombinase binding.
primer_length = 30-38

# The maximum allowed length for a mononucleotide run (e.g., AAAAA).
# A value of 4 is a standard practice to prevent polymerase slippage.
max_homopolymer_run = 4

# The allowed percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases.
# 40-60% provides a good balance of stability and specificity.
gc_content_range_percent = 30-70

[AMPLICON_PARAMETERS]
# The desired size of the amplified product (the amplicon) in base pairs.
# RPA is most efficient with smaller amplicons.
amplicon_length_range_bp = 120-180

[SCORING_THRESHOLDS]
# The minimum acceptable melting temperature (Tm) in Celsius.
# Even though RPA is isothermal, a high Tm ensures the primer is stable and specific.
min_melting_temp_celsius = 50.0

# A penalty threshold for self-dimerization, represented by a delta G value in kcal/mol.
# A more negative value indicates a stronger, more problematic bond. A value of -9
# is a good starting point to filter out significant self-dimers.
max_self_dimer_delta_g = -9.0

# A penalty threshold for cross-dimerization between the forward and reverse primers.
# Similar to self-dimers, this prevents the primers from binding to each other instead of the target.
max_cross_dimer_delta_g = -9.0

# The minimum required conservation score at the 3' end. A score of 1.0 is a perfect match.
# NOTE: Set this to 0.0 unless you are designing primers against a variable target (e.g., a virus)
# and are using a multiple sequence alignment.
min_conservation_score_3_prime = 0.0

# The percentage of sequence match tolerance for unwanted secondary structures.
# This setting is less common; delta G values are a more direct measure of secondary structure stability.
max_secondary_structure_percent = 20

[OUTPUT_SETTINGS]
# The maximum number of top-scoring primer pairs to output in the final report.
# Reviewing around 20 pairs is usually sufficient to find a few excellent candidates.
max_output_sets = 20
