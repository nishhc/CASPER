# CASPER

CASPER (Combined Amplification & Spacer Engine for RPA-Cas12a)  is a combined RPA primer and CRISPR-Cas12 crRNA designer optimized to create pairs that work together effectively. Given a target (and optional background genomes), CASPER generates sequences and produces rankings for candidate RPA amplicons and primers as well as crRNAs based on a composite ranking framework that takes into account multiple scores for features used in generation.
